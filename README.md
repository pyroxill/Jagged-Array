# Jagged Array - Jayden Robertson

A simple console application built using C# that demonstrates the use of jagged arrays using titles, forenames and surnames.

## Features
- Declare a jagged array to store titles, forenames, and surnames.
- Provides console output to display formatted names.


## How It Works
The program declares a jagged array containing three rows:

Titles (Mr, Mrs, Ms)
Forenames (Anna, Jones, Ian)
Surnames (Smith, Johnson, Brown)
It then accesses elements from each row to form and display their full names.
